I successfully conducted a comprehensive data analysis project utilizing SQL and Power BI to assess hotel revenue trends and parking space utilization. The primary objective was to determine whether there has been consistent revenue growth over a specified period.

 Collected, cleaned, and integrated hotel revenue data, as well as parking space occupancy data from various sources, ensuring data quality and consistency.

 Employed SQL queries to extract relevant information, such as revenue figures, guest bookings, and parking space occupancy rates, enabling a more profound analysis.

 Utilized Power BI to create interactive and insightful data visualizations, including revenue trend graphs, occupancy rate charts, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to present findings effectively.

 Conducted a detailed analysis of historical hotel revenue data to identify patterns and trends, and applied statistical techniques to determine growth or stagnation.
 The analysis revealed that there has been a consistent upward trend in hotel revenue over the specified time period.
